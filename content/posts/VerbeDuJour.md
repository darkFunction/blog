I've hacked together a new site in Flask to assist with learning French. The idea is that a new verb is chosen every day, and users are able to see all conjugations as well as search for other verbs. It has been great using Flask- it takes (almost) all of the pain out of web development. Definitely recommended! Clicky click: [Learn French and Conjugate Your Verbs!](http://www.verbedujour.com)

Been getting really good feedback over at [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/comment/6441685) and [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/2sc6m7/i_made_a_site_to_help_you_learn_one_verb_a_day/), it's really encouraging.

And a massive **Thank You** to Audrey for patiently error checking my sources and recording ~1200 audio samples!
