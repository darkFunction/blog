Built a website and API backend (https://www.ticketsamaritan.uk/) using Vapor after attending [Serverside.swift conference](https://www.serversideswift.info/) in Berlin. I explored serverless technologies offered by IBM but ultimately Vapor turned out to be a great option and Vapor Cloud especially makes for easy deployment and database hosting.

The site is for travellers to share free tickets and has received [postive responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/9nkbck/lots_of_posts_about_spare_rail_tickets_here/) on Reddit. I think it needs a simple app to be really useful but since the API is done this is something that can be put together pretty quickly in the future.
