Launched a site called [threadpaint.art](https://www.threadpaint.art) that lets you generate instructions for neat artworks made from a continuous line of thread. 

I tried to build a stepper motor attachment to make building these pieces really easy, and it kinda worked except the wooden chassis was too flexible and caused too much wobble! ([See video](https://streamable.com/jh2uk)) Originally I wanted to have a robot arm do it, but nothing has the precision until you start getting into expensive, industrial-level tools.
